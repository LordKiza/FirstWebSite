                    Spyro Reignited Trilogy is a collection of remasters of the first three games in the Spyro series:
                    Spyro the Dragon,
                    Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon; all of which were originally developed by
                    Insomniac Games for
                    the PlayStation and released from 1998 to 2000. It was announced on April 5, 2018, following the
                    release of Crash
                    Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was a similar collection of remasters of the first three Crash
                    Bandicoot titles that
                    Activision also published. Eurogamer noted there was a high public demand for a classic Spyro
                    trilogy to receive
                    the same treatment after N. Sane Trilogy was released.

                    Tom Kenny, who voiced Spyro the Dragon in the original Ripto's Rage! and Year of the Dragon, will
                    reprise his role in Spyro Reignited Trilogy with re-recorded voice lines, including the first game,
                    in which Spyro was originally voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Stewart Copeland, the music
                    composer of the three original games, wrote a new main theme for the compilation. His original
                    compositions for the games were remastered by Stephan Vankov, an employee of Toys for Bob, with the
                    game including an option to choose between the two soundtracks. Reignited Trilogy will use the
                    Unreal Engine 4 game engine.

                    After initially being scheduled for release on September 21, 2018, it was delayed until November
                    13, 2018 as Toys for Bob stated the project needed "more love and care". The physical
                    release of Reignited Trilogy only contains content from Spyro the Dragon, while Ripto's Rage! and
                    Year of the Dragon must be downloaded as part of an in-game update. Despite the delay however,
                    the game will still require a launch day patch.
